# playdate-usb

JavaScript library for interacting with a [Playdate](http://play.date/) console over USB, wherever [webUSB](https://web.dev/usb/) is supported.

## Features

 - Execute secret commands on your Playdate over USB
 - Get Playdate device stats such as its version info, serial, cpu stats, memory usage, etc
 - Take a screenshot of the Playdate screen and draw it to a HTML5 canvas, or send an image to be previewed on the Playdate screen
 - Exports full Typescript types, has zero dependencies, and only ~4kb minified and gzipped

## Notes

WebUSB is only supported in [*Secure Contexts*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), and only in [certain browsers]() (Currently Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera).

The commands that this library wraps with functions (such as `getVersion()` or `getScreen()`) are known to be safe, are used by the Playdate Simulator, and have been tested on actual Playdate hardware. However, some of the commands that you can potentially run with `runCommand()` could be dangerous, and might even harm your favorite yellow handheld if you don't know what you're doing. *Please* don't execute any commands that you're unsure about.

Also, due to the asynchronous nature of webUSB, this library uses [`async/await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) a lot. If you're not already familiar with that, now would be a good time to catch up!

## Examples

TODO

## Installation

### With NPM

```shell
  npm install playdate-usb --save
```

Then assuming you're using a module-compatible system (like Webpack, Rollup, etc):

```js
import { requestConnectPlaydate } from 'playdate-usb';

async function connectToPlaydate() {
  const playdate = await requestConnectPlaydate();
}
```

### Directly in a browser

Using the modules directly via Unpkg:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { openDB, deleteDB, wrap, unwrap } from 'https://unpkg.com/playdate-usb?module';

  async function connectToPlaydate() {
  const playdate = await requestConnectPlaydate();
}
</script>
```

Using an external script reference

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/playdate-usb/dist/playdate-usb.min.js"></script>
<script>
  async function connectToPlaydate() {
    const playdate = await requestConnectPlaydate();
  }
</script>
```

When using the library this way, a global called `playdateUsb` will be created containing all the exports from the module version.

## Usage

### Detecting webUSB support

`isUsbSupported()` 

### Connecting a Playdate

### PlaydateDevice API

#### `open()`

Opens the device for communication. This will throw an error if the device cannot be opened
